	abstract = {We introduce an electro-optic hardware platform for nonlinear activation functions in optical neural networks. The optical-to-optical nonlinearity operates by converting a small portion of the input optical signal into an analog electric signal, which is used to intensity-modulate the original optical signal with no reduction in processing speed. Our scheme allows for complete nonlinear on-off contrast in transmission at relatively low optical power thresholds and eliminates the requirement of having additional optical sources between each layer of the network. Moreover, the activation function is reconfigurable via electrical bias, allowing it to be programmed or trained to synthesize a variety of nonlinear responses. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this activation function significantly improves the expressiveness of optical neural networks, allowing them to perform well on two benchmark machine learning tasks: learning a multi-input exclusive-{OR} ({XOR}) logic function and classification of images of handwritten numbers from the {MNIST} dataset. The addition of the nonlinear activation function improves test accuracy on the {MNIST} task from 85\% to 94\%.},

	abstract = {Reconfigurable photonic mesh networks of tunable beamsplitter nodes can linearly transform \$N\$-dimensional vectors representing input modal amplitudes of light for applications such as energy-efficient machine learning hardware, quantum information processing, and mode demultiplexing. Such photonic meshes are typically programmed and/or calibrated by tuning or characterizing each beam splitter one-by-one, which can be time-consuming and can limit scaling to larger meshes. Here we introduce a graph-topological approach that defines the general class of feedforward networks commonly used in such applications and identifies columns of non-interacting nodes that can be adjusted simultaneously. By virtue of this approach, we can calculate the necessary input vectors to program entire columns of nodes in parallel by simultaneously nullifying the power in one output of each node via optoelectronic feedback onto adjustable phase shifters or couplers. This parallel nullification approach is fault-tolerant to fabrication errors, requiring no prior knowledge or calibration of the node parameters, and can reduce the programming time by a factor of order \$N\$ to being proportional to the optical depth (or number of node columns in the device). As a demonstration, we simulate our programming protocol on a feedforward optical neural network model trained to classify handwritten digit images from the {MNIST} dataset with up to 98\% validation accuracy.},

Conventional digital electronic computing platforms are incapable of executing truly complex-valued representations and operations. In contrast, optical computing platforms that encode information in both phase and magnitude can execute complex arithmetic by optical interference, offering significantly enhanced computational speed and energy efficiency. However, to date, most demonstrations of optical neural networks still only utilize conventional real-valued frameworks that are designed for digital computers, forfeiting many of the advantages of optical computing such as efficient complex-valued operations. In this article, we highlight an optical neural chip ({ONC}) that implements truly complex-valued neural networks. We benchmark the performance of our complex-valued {ONC} in four settings: simple Boolean tasks, species classification of an Iris dataset, classifying nonlinear datasets (Circle and Spiral), and handwriting recognition. Strong learning capabilities (i.e., high accuracy, fast convergence and the capability to construct nonlinear decision boundaries) are achieved by our complex-valued {ONC} compared to its real-valued counterpart.},

	abstract = {Recent success in deep neural networks has generated strong interest in hardware accelerators to improve speed and energy consumption. This paper presents a new type of photonic accelerator based on coherent detection that is scalable to large (N≳106) networks and can be operated at high (gigahertz) speeds and very low (subattojoule) energies per multiply and accumulate ({MAC}), using the massive spatial multiplexing enabled by standard free-space optical components. In contrast to previous approaches, both weights and inputs are optically encoded so that the network can be reprogrammed and trained on the fly. Simulations of the network using models for digit and image classification reveal a “standard quantum limit” for optical neural networks, set by photodetector shot noise. This bound, which can be as low as 50 {zJ}/{MAC}, suggests that performance below the thermodynamic (Landauer) limit for digital irreversible computation is theoretically possible in this device. The proposed accelerator can implement both fully connected and convolutional networks. We also present a scheme for backpropagation and training that can be performed in the same hardware. This architecture will enable a new class of ultralow-energy processors for deep learning.},

Because all errors from different optical neurons are independent, it is possible to scale up the size of such an {AONN}. Moreover, our hardware system is reconfigurable for different applications without the need to modify the physical structure. We confirm its capability and feasibility in machine-learning application by successfully classifying order and disorder phases of a statistical Ising model.

Today's optical neural networks are mainly developed to perform optical inference after in silico training on digital simulators. However, various physical imperfections that cannot be accurately modelled may lead to the notorious reality gap between the digital simulator and the physical system. To address this challenge, we demonstrate hybrid training of optical neural networks where the weight matrix is trained with neuron activation functions computed optically via forward propagation through the network. We examine the efficacy of hybrid training with three different networks: an optical linear classifier, a hybrid opto-electronic network, and a complex-valued optical network. We perform a comparative study to in silico training, and our results show that hybrid training is robust against different kinds of static noise. Our platform-agnostic hybrid training scheme can be applied to a wide variety of optical neural networks, and this work paves the way towards advanced all-optical training in machine intelligence.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the performance and energy efficiency of Netcast, a recently proposed optical neural-network architecture designed for edge computing. Netcast performs deep neural network inference by dividing the computational task into two steps, which are split between the server and (edge) client: (1) the server employs a wavelength-multiplexed modulator array to encode the network's weights onto an optical signal in an analog time-frequency basis, and (2) the client obtains the desired matrix-vector product through modulation and time-integrated detection. The simultaneous use of wavelength multiplexing, broadband modulation, and integration detection allows large neural networks to be run at the client by effectively pushing the energy and memory requirements back to the server. The performance and energy efficiency are fundamentally limited by crosstalk and detector noise, respectively. We derive analytic expressions for these limits and perform numerical simulations to verify these bounds.},
